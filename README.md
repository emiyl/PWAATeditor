# PWAATeditor
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy Save Editor

## Features

- Unlocking Chapters
- Changing in-game settings
- Setting custom resolutions

## Compatibility

This has been tested on the PC and Nintendo Switch versions of the game.

Since the addresses were the same for both devices, I imagine this tool will work on other consoles, but I haven't tested.

Always make a backup and use at your own risk!

## Known Issues

- After closing a save file, you must restart the program before you can alter any save files again
